Version 1.0.0rc7 - 14 April, 2021
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE - Backwards Incompatibility Notice !!!! Read below.

First release from new GitHub location.

Due to an unfortunate server crash, the Vespa project has been relocated to
GitHub at:

https://github.com/vespa-mrs/vespa      (Vespa source repository)

Vespa documentation (installation, user manuals and development topics) have
their own GitHub repository and GitHub Pages site as well, at:

https://github.com/vespa-mrs/vespa.io   (Vespa docs repository)
https://vespa-mrs.github.io/vespa.io/   (Vespa Pages web site)

The Vespa repository remains primarily a resource for developers as the Vespa
package can still be installed from PyPI under the name of Vespa-Suite:

https://pypi.org/project/Vespa-Suite/

Please note that the PyGAMMA/GAMMA package, one of Vespa's dependencies, has
also relocated to GitHub with the following locations:

https://github.com/pygamma-mrs/gamma/     (PyGAMMA/GAMMA source repository)
https://github.com/pygamma-mrs/gamma.io/  (PyGAMMA/GAMMA docs repository)
https://pygamma-mrs.github.io/gamma.io/   (PyGAMMA/GAMMA GitHub Pages web site)

Application Changes
============================

Due to a lot of free time during the COVID-19 pandemic, Vespa has been rewritten,
refactored, and redesigned to work under Python 3.x. Due to numerous changes in 
the Vespa code, this version does NOT work in Python 2.7.x anymore. But, the
overall program is backwards compatible at the database and VIFF and other saved
file formats. Ie. it should read in your old *.xml results sets just fine.

We have bumped a major version number to 1.0.0 to reflect this change. There
may still be a few bugs under the hood from all the coding 'improvements' but
we are working diligently to squash them all as reported.

Analysis
--------------
- added algorithms to Preprocess tab for more Coil combination, Data Exclusion,
  B0 and Phase Correction, and more ways to display and review results.
- added standard data parsers for Philips DICOM MRS files, Siemens Twix sLASER
  files from CMRR, Siemens Twix svs_se and Twix svs_se_edit WIP529 files.
- moved wavelet filter baseline code into Python code
- moved HLSVDPro water removal into Python code
- HLSVDPro results from the Analysis 'Spectral' sub-tab can now be output for
  use in other applications or user's projects.
- added LMFIT optimizaton to Analysis to allow users to set inequality constraints
  on metabolite frequencies to better separate small peaks from larger ones to
  which they are adjacent.
- there is a single and multi-page results output called 'LCM Layout' that can
  be sent to PDF or PNG. This simulates a layout similar to LCModel.

Simulation
-------------
- slight change to default plot layouts in the Experiment-Visualize sub-tab.
  Windows are set up at tabs on first plot. User can then move the tabs into
  a more side-by-side layout if they desire.

DataSim
-------------
- The previous 'Priorset' app has been renamed to 'DataSim' for better clarity
  (otherwise know as a 'marketing decision' :)
- Separated the 'Baseline' tab into two separate tabs now called 'Baseline' and
  'Macromolecules'. This allows users to create these two signal contributions
  separately using either Gaussian or Lorentzian lineshapes.
- HSLVDPro fitting results from the Analysis 'Spectral' sub-tab can be read
  into the 'Macromolecules' tab and turned on/off to create a simulated MMol
  signal contribution.

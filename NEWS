Version 1.0.0rc4 - 18 September, 2020
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First release from new GitHub location.

Due to an unfortunate server crash, the vespa project has been relocated to
GitHub at:

https://github.com/vespa-mrs/vespa

Vespa documentation (installation, user manuals and development topics) have
their own GitHub repository and GitHub Pages site as well, at:

https://github.com/vespa-mrs/vespa.io   (Vespa repository)
https://vespa-mrs.github.io/vespa.io/   (Vespa Pages web site)

The Vespa repository remains primarily a resource for developers as the Vespa
package can still be installed from PyPI under the name of Vespa-Suite:

https://pypi.org/search/?q=vespa-suite

Please note that the PyGAMMA/GAMMA package, one of Vespa's dependencies, has
also relocated to GitHub with the following locations:

https://github.com/pygamma-mrs/gamma/     (PyGAMMA/GAMMA source repo)
https://github.com/pygamma-mrs/gamma.io/  (PyGAMMA/GAMMA docs repo)
https://pygamma-mrs.github.io/gamma.io/   (PyGAMMA/GAMMA GitHub Pages web site)



Version 1.0.0rc3 - 18 September, 2020
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE - Backwards Incompatibility Notice !!!! Read below.

Due to a lot of free time during the COVID-19 pandemic, Vespa has been rewritten,
refactored, and redesigned to work under Python 3.x. Due to numerous changes in 
the Vespa code, this version does not work in Python 2.7.x anymore. But,
the overall program is backwards compatible at the database and VIFF and other
saved file formats. Ie. it should read in your old *.xml results sets just
fine. 

We have bumped a major version number to 1.0.0 to reflect this change. There
may still be a few bugs under the hood from all the coding 'improvements' but
we are working diligently to squash them all as reported.

Major Changes
--------------

- added algorithms to Preprocess tab for more Coil combination, Data Exclusion,
  B0 and Phase Correction, and more ways to display and review results.
- added standard data parsers for Philips DICOM MRS files, Siemens Twix sLASER
  files from CMRR, Siemens Twix svs_se files, Siemens Twix svs_se_edit WIP529
  files.
- moved HLSVDPro water removal into Python code
- moved wavelet filter baseline code into Python code
- Vespa now uses most-ish recent wxPython, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, pydicom 
  and other dependencies modules.
- renamed the Priorset application to DataSim for better clarity of purpose.

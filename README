DESCRIPTION:

Vespa stands for Versatile Simulation, Pulses, and Analysis. It is an 
integrated, open source, open development platform that contains four magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (MRS) software applications, written in Python, called: 
    
  Pulse      - RF pulse design
  Simulation - spectral simulation and prototyping
  DataSim    - application for creating synthetic MRS data sets 
  Analysis   - spectral data processing and analysis
    
The Vespa project addresses previous software limitations, of non-standard data
access, closed source and multiple language software that complicates algorithm 
extension, and a lack of integration between programs by porting all the code 
to Python, and using a shared database design, with high-quality documentation. 

These applications can be run separately, but can also communicate via a shared 
database of objects/results. Integration allows one application to use the 
output from another as input. For example, Simulation can make use of an RF 
pulse designed in Pulse to create a more realistic MR simulation.

HISTORY

The Vespa package is an extensive redesign of three previous MRS software tools:

  MatPulse   (Pulse) - software for RF pulse design written in Matlab, 
  GAVA/Gamma (Simulation) - software for spectral simulation code in IDL
  IDL_Vespa  (Analysis) - spectral data processing and analysis code in IDL 

Thanks to the NIH (grant number 1R01EB008387-01A1) for funding the maintenance 
and extension of these separate applications into a combined environment based 
entirely on the Python language.

COMPATIBILITY:

Vespa has been tested and is certified to run on the following systems: 
Windows, Macintosh OSX, and Linux. 

However, it should run on any system that supports python 3.x and wxpython.

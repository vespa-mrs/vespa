"""There are three layers of Prefs classes. They are --

       Prefs
         |
         |
  App-specific Prefs (e.g. AnalysisPrefs, SimulationPrefs, etc.)
         |
         |
  Tab-specific Prefs (e.g. PrefsVoigt)         


You'll never need to instantiate classes from the first two layers. In fact, 
you can't -- they're abstract base classes. They define interfaces and provide
some common functions, but you don't need them directly.

Most of the interesting stuff happens at the bottom (Prefs) layer, which 
speaks to the fact that most of this code is the same. 

The app-specific Prefs classes contain very little. In fact, they exist only
to provide a property that tells the class which INI file to use.

The tab-specific prefs mostly exist to provide the _ini_section_name property
and inflate/deflate specifics.

BJS - additional comments 
----------------------------------

So I admit that I do not completely understand how these Prefs work.  So what
I write here is mostly empirical and some trial/error practicality.

Most of the  Prefs attributes are filled by turning the ViewIdsXxxx values in 
util_menu.py module from UPPER_CASE to lower_case and using these strings as
argument to setattr().  The ViewIdsXxxx values specific to the Tab being
instantiated are used (as listed in the __init__ call at the top of the tab's
__init__ code).  Yes, double inits.  

A second way to set a Prefs attribute is in the local prefs.py module in the
inflate() method for whatever tab (e.g. PrefsSpectral class). The attributes
listed in this location are NOT modified by a menu item, thus I consider them
to be 'static' prefs. Modifiable in the INI file, but not dynamically in the 
program.  But, can also be values other than Boolean, which is nice.

So, when should we add something to the common/default_ini_file_content?  By
trial and error, I deduced that you HAVE to add a value here if you are going
to put the prefs attribute in the inflate() method.  If you are setting the
value in the util_menu module, you can set a default here, or just let the 
menu handling code default on its own.

    implements some work-saving magic that allows its subclasses to ignore
    most boolean & radio-type preferences reflected on the menu (e.g. show zero
    line, data type real/imag/magnitude, etc.).

    In particular, each instance of a Prefs object has a number of 
    "automatic" attributes. These attrs are not explicitly enumerated in the
    class definition. Rather, they are created by inference at class

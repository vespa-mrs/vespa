BJS - Feb 2024 as I start on a FIRE version of Inline
----------------------------------------------------------

My original inline project used xmlrpc calls from ICE to Python, both on the MARS/MRIR computer.

This required that I compile an xmlrpc lib for linux and create a conda python env that I transplanted to the MRIR on the shared drive
- precarious to say the least

I am now starting a FIRE version of all this. So I'm archiving this code/etc. one level down in the repo.
